The fourth industrial revolution has birthed a vast but confusing gold mine of data, quantitative and semantic.

In order to take maximum advantage of this opportunity, I have equipped myself with a Statistics major and Philosophy minor, empowering me to identify and extract the dominant key patterns from a bird’s-eye view.

My unique value proposition is the ability to combine machine learning-leveraged mathematical modeling with creative, generalized, philosophical strategic reasoning, fueling your organization’s decision-making process with an empirically grounded analysis distilled to the key insights.
